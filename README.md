 Bayesian Cognitive Modelling of Face Recognition

Answers represent:

- NR  - "I did not recognise the person"
- C   - "I got it right"            
- TT  - "I got it wrong, but the correct name was “on the tip of my tongue”"
- RNN - "I recognised the person, but I could not remember their name"   


This can be linked to the structure of the paper "Integrating predictive frameworks and cognitive models of face perception" (Trapp et al., 2018).

Data is drawn from a pilot study of the following paper: "Stimulus material selection for the Dutch famous faces test for older adults" (Van den Elzen et al., 2023) - https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2023.1124986/full
